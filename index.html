				    	Sarah Cabral’s work “is as authentic and inviting, as it is sophisticated” --QUOTE.
						<br><br>
				    	Born in southern Brazil, Sarah Cabral grew up in a time of great influence from North American pop music and music contained within telenovelas. Despite this and having moved to the United States in the early 2000’s, Cabral never lost touch with the deep roots that exist in Brazilian music.
						<br><br>
						This connection permeates throughout her debut, self-titled album, which Cabral also produced. In it, she draws on modern jazz, avant-garde and classical influences, and breathes new life into seemingly bygone eras of traditional and popular Brazilian music.
						<br><br>
						Cabral studied at The California Jazz Conservatory with mentor Marcos Silva. She is also a member of the group Brazil Beat with mandolinist Eva Scow, guitarist Mike Taylor and percussionist Alex Calatayud. The group continues to perform together and was a strong contributor to the debut EP. In 2012, when Carlos Oliveira and Ricardo Peixoto recorded '40 Years of Brazilian' Masterpieces at The Berkeley Hillside Club, they invited Cabral to contribute the vocals. She has also collaborated with artists such as Fabiano Chagas, Scott Thompson, Wayne Wallace, The Danny Green Trio and the legendary Bororo Felipe – with many more planned in 2017.
						<br><br>
						Cabral currently lives in New York City and working on her next album. She also continues to perform at notable venues and festivals, including Yoshi’s, Red Poppy Art House, Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, The Uptown Nightclub, Arte Américas, as well as Bar LunÀtico and Zinc Bar in New York City.
