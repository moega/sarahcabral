				Vocalist and songwriter Sarah Cabral was born in southern Brazil. Her work often explores multiple musical genres from traditional and popular Brazilian music to modern jazz, avant-garde and classical.
				<br><br>
				She studied at The California Jazz Conservatory with mentor Marcos Silva, with whom she continues to collaborate. In 2012 she was part of “40 Years of Brazilian Masterpieces” with Carlos Oliveira and Ricardo Peixoto – recorded live at The Berkeley Hillside Club. From 2013 to today, Cabral has worked with Vagabundo Records and the legendary Bororo Felipe and Fabiano Chagas on musical exchanges and performances between California and Brazil. Cabral has also recorded and performed with, among others, Jeff Buens, Scott Thompson, Wayne Wallace and The Danny Green Trio.
				<br><br>
				In 2015, she released the self-titled Sarah Cabral EP, which Cabral also produced. This project presents a uniquely contemporary approach to Brazilian classics in addition to original compositions from top talents like Ian Faquini. Cabral is also a member of the group Brazil Beat with mandolinist Eva Scow, guitarist Mike Taylor and percussionist Alex Calatayud. The group continues to perform together and was a strong contributor to the debut EP.
				<br><br>
				Cabral has performed at notable venues and festivals, including The Music Box, Yoshi’s, Red Poppy Art House, Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, The Uptown Nightclub, Fulton 55 and Arte Américas. She is currently living and studying in New York City.
